Computing the covariance between two data vectors of length $n$ requires
$O(n)$ operations. A sample $n \times p$ covariance matrix requires
$(p + 1)p / 2$ vector covariances. So the whole covariance matrix needs
$$
    O(n) frac{(p + 1) p}{2}
$$
Suppose we model wall time required for an $n \times p$ sample covariance
calculation as:
$$
    t = c + b n (p + 1) p / 2 + \epsilon
$$
where $c$ is the constant overhead and $\epsilon$ is the random error.
