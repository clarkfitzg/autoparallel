Measure CPU utilization during timings to see what's parallel / threaded.

Change the whole testing strategy. It's not working. Try to use shell
redirection.

Create example where transfer is initiated earlier than it's received.

move variable names in the plot

Most functions in the list scheduling use the same bunch of five components
that get passed around, so it might make sense to package that stuff up in
a list.

The script below can really only use 2 workers, and it seems to do weird
stuff if I pass maxworkers = 3L:

script = parse("script4.R")
tg = task_graph(script)
schedule = minimize_start_time(script, tg, maxworkers = 3L)
plot(schedule)

How do other packages express parallelism?

- parallel substitutes lapply with mclapply
- foreach defines its own looping construct: `x <- foreach(i=1:3) %dopar% sqrt(i)`
