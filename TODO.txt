# TODO

Before release on CRAN:

- Vignettes.
- Show a realistic script as an example that actually benefits from task parallelism.
- Write the `data_parallel()` function, including modification of for loops
  into parallel code.
- Simplify `write_hive_scripts()` to do less. The burden should be on the
  users to write the SQL.

Less urgent:

- Alternative scheduling algorithm and code generator based on fork / join.
- Measure CPU utilization during timings to see what's parallel / threaded.
