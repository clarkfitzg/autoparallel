Description: This package provides tools to automatically transform serial
    R code into a parallel version. It does this through examination of R code
    and timings. The primary intended use case is an R script that takes too
    long (at least more than a second!) Other use cases include interactive
    analysis of large data sets, detection of task parallelism, and
    code transformations.
