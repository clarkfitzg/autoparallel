Description: This experimental package provides tools to automatically
    transform serial R code into more efficient parallel versions.
    The primary intended use case is an R script that takes too
    long (at least more than a second!) Other use cases include interactive
    analysis of large data sets, detection of task parallelism, and
    code transformations.
