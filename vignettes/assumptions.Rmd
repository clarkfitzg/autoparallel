# Assumptions

I may want to make some of the following assumptions, depending on
convenience.

Input in a canonical form. Have to say precisely what this means. For
example:

- `<-` is used for assignment rather than `=` or `assign`
- All statements in the program are necessary, in the sense that they lead
  to something with a side effect.
