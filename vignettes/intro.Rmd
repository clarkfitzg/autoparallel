# Introduction

This package is meant to simplify parallel programming in R by automating
common tasks.

My goal in creating this package was to produce something that I find
personally useful.

As data sizes and processor counts increase, parallelism becomes more
important.

Parallel programming can be challenging, because it requires further levels
of expertise. The core of R is a functional language, and the functional
paradigm is well suited to parallel programming. 

R functions typically don't have side effects. They don't modify their
arguments; instead they produce new objects. This is what makes R
functional and what allows us to do parallel computing.

## Prior Art

SNOW, parallel packages now included with R as recommended packages.

Bohringer's dynamic parallelization.

Bengsston's futures.
