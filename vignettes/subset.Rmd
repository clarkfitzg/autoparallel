_Transpile_ here refers to translating and changing code to make it more
efficient. Consider this simple script:

```{R, eval = FALSE}

d = read.csv("data.csv")

hist(d[, 1])

```

This script only uses the first column of `d`, which means that all the
other columns were unnecessary. If `data.csv` is sufficiently large then
this program will spend an excessive amount of time reading data that are
never used.

In general we'd like to do all the preprocessing as early as possible,
saving only what we need.

```{R}

library(codedoctor)

script = parse(text = '
    d = read.csv("data.csv")
    hist(d[, 2])
    ')

# TODO: Infer and remove 2nd argument.
read_faster(script, "d")

```


## Static Analysis

`read_faster()` uses static code analysis to infer which columns are
required to run the complete script.  For example, we can statically
analyze literals and evaluate simple functions such as `c()`:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
mtcars[, c(1L, 3L)]
mtcars[, "mpg"]
mtcars$mpg
```

Through constant propagation we can also handle variables defined from
literals:

```{R, eval = FALSE}
cols = c("cyl", disp")
mtcars[, cols]
```

While we cannot statically analyze code where the value isn't known until
runtime.

```{R, eval = FALSE}

# TODO: Decide. Currently this fails, but could just as easily have it be a
# warning.
read_faster(parse(text = '
    d = read.csv("data.csv")
    hist(d[, rpois(1, 1)])
'), "d")

```

### Inferring column names

If the code does not use subsets based on column names then it doesn't
matter what the column names are. 

If the column names are initially specified, ie:

```{R, eval = FALSE}

d = read.table("data.csv", col.names = c("a", "b", "c"))

```

then we know the column names.

Lastly, if `header = TRUE` we can try to look at the data itself to infer
the column names. We can only try, because the location of the data may
not be the same as the location where `read_faster()` is called.


## Future Work

### Necessary 

_These tasks should be completed before a public release._

Verify the indices subsetting `d` can be computed at the time of
static analysis.

Check if any commands imply that the whole data set must be loaded. For
example:

```{R}
d = read.csv("data.csv")
d[, 5] = 2
write.csv(d, "data2.csv")  # Uses all columns of d
```

Handle variables which are redefined. This could likely be done through a
single static assignment (SSA) preprocessing step. For example, the
following is problematic because we must restrict the code analysis and
transformations to `x` before it is redefined:

```{R}

x = read.csv("data.csv")
print(x[1, 1])
x = list(1, 2, 3)
print(x[[1]])

```


### Nice to Have

_These tasks are less critical._

Account for indirect use of variables. The following should infer that the
4th column is used.

```{R, eval = FALSE}
d = read.csv("data.csv")
d2 = d * 2
d2[, 4]
```

Read subsets without corresponding variable assignments, for example:

```{R}
hist(read.csv("data.csv")[, 2])
```

More complicated forms of assignment

```{R}
a = b = read.csv("data.csv")
```

Further column selection operations including non standard evaluation such
as using `subset`, or `lm(y ~ x, data)`.

TODO: Return to this point, continue editing down into user facing manual.
Design stuff can live in the other doc.

## Implementation

How can we tell which columns are used?


Fri Sep 22 10:31:23 PDT 2017

For the moment I'm ignoring NSE such as `subset`.

Thinking now that it's fine to depend on `data.table`.
`data.table::fread` has a `select` parameter for column names. It would be
more convenient for our purposes here if `select` took an integer vector of
the column indices instead. Indices are more general because:

- Not every text file has column names
- Not every data frame has meaningful column names
- Column names may not be unique

One approach is to take all the uses of column names and map them into
integers.
The code will go through three representations then:

__Original__ including mixed names and integers:

```{R}

mpg = mtcars$mpg
cyl = mtcars[, 2]
disp = mtcars[, "disp"]
wt = mtcars[[5]]

```

__Name Replacement__ substitutes the names with integers, and converts all
`data.frame` subsetting commands into single `[`. Assume that we know the
column names.

```{R}

mpg = mtcars[, 1]
cyl = mtcars[, 2]
disp = mtcars[, 3]
wt = mtcars[, 5]

```

As we replace names we can update the set of variables which are used, so that
after processing all statements we know which are used.


__Subset mapping__ maps the original indices to corresponding indices in the
smaller `data.frame`. The index map is a sorted integer vector of the
columns that are used. This step cannot happen with the previous because
it's necessary to first know all the columns which will be used.

```{R}

index_map = c(1, 2, 3, 5)

# Suppose fread supports integers here
.mtcars = fread(..., select = index_map)

mpg = .mtcars[, 1]
cyl = .mtcars[, 2]
disp = .mtcars[, 3]
wt = .mtcars[, 4]   # This one changes

```

## Details

__Nested subsetting__

Suppose that `x` is the data frame of interest. Consider the following
reasonable code:

```
x[x[, "d"] > 10, "b"]
```

Replacing names gives us the following in standard form:

x[x[, 4] > 10, 2]

Because there is nested subsetting we need to respect the structure of the
parse tree to correctly substitute these variables with indices.

TODO: What is the issue in my mind? I don't want this to happen:
```
# First step updates the inner
x[x[, 4] > 10, "b"]

# Second step updates the outer based on the original statement
x[x[, "d"] > 10, 2]
```

This leaves us with the task of having to merge the parse trees. We
definitely want to avoid this. So we need to update the tree in place,
incrementally. In the more general case it may happen that the locations of
the parse tree change as it is modified.  Then we'll need a way to guarantee
that nothing is overwritten. Maybe applying the changes depth first?


## Limitations

What are the limitations of the approach that I've just outlined? 

It's really only designed for data frames. So it would be a little
dangerous if I _think_ something is a data frame, when in fact it's a list.
Then if I replace `[[` and `$` with `[` it won't work. I can get around
this by focusing on functions that return data frames, for example
`read.csv()`.

I haven't yet considered subsetting rows, there may be a way to do that
efficiently.  A common way is to subset based on the value of some column.
I could do this by keeping on open file pointer, reading a chunk of the
data, subset it, add that subset to a list, then rbind the subsets
together. This potentially lets R quickly process files larger than memory.

How to get every column which is used when new copies of the data frame
are created? For example:

```{R}

mtcars2 = mtcars[possible_subset, ]

# Now `gear` column must be read in.
mtcars2$gear

```

Stepping back, R has many ways to write programs. To simplify tasks here we
first put the code into a canonical form, and then do "surgery" on it.


## Side Notes


info = lapply(code, CodeDepends::getInputs)

# The CodeDepends output says when `read.csv` func is called, which is
# helpful. But it doesn't let me see if the result of `read.csv` is
# assigned to a variable, which is what I need.

code2 = quote(x <- rnorm(n = read.csv("data.csv")))

CodeDepends::getInputs(code2)
