# Script

Parallelism is useful if it improves the speed of a slow program. If speed
doesn't improve then parallelism is an unnecessary complication.
`autoparallel` provides ways to determine if parallelism will help a
program along with the transformation.

The word 'program' means a collection of valid R statements. This could be
a script or a function.

## Basic Transformations

We begin with the simplest and most obvious way to transform a program.
Top level occurences of `lapply, mapply, Map` are changed to `mclapply,
mcmapply, mcMap` from the `parallel` package, and the run times are
compared.  Below `lapply, mapply, Map` are referred to as the 'target
statements'.

This technique may be useful if the following conditions are met:

- System supports fork based parallelism (not Windows)
- Program spends a large amount of time in the target statements
- Program will be ran many times (benchmark requires program to run)
- Repeated evaluation of the target statements doesn't change output or
  have otherwise adverse effects, ie. repeatedly writing data to places it
  should not.

Consider the following simple program:

```{R}

# simple.R

ffast = function(x) rnorm(1)

fslow = function(x){
    Sys.sleep(0.1)
    rnorm(1)
}

z = 1:10
r1 = lapply(z, ffast)
r2 = lapply(z, fslow)

```

To make this run faster the last line should be changed to:

```{R}

r2 = parallel::mclapply(x, fslow)

```

To transform it:


```{R}

autoparallel::benchmark_transform("simple.R", output = "simple2.R")

```
