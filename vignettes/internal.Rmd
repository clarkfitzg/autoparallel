# Internal Design Documentation

This document is not intended for users. It contains the following:

- design decisions
- TODO lists
- possible ideas and extensions


# TODO

Estimate more precisely the costs of serialization. Is it much cheaper
to do it directly vs using `mccollect()`?


# Ideas

Write a function to check if code is IO bound.

Are there cheaper ways to share read only copies of objects between
processes in R? There's `bigmemory`, but what about something a little more
generalized like the plasma object store?
