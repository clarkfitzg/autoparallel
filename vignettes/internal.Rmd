# Internal Design Documentation

This document is not intended for users. It contains the following:

- design decisions
- TODO lists
- possible ideas and extensions


# TODO

Estimate more precisely the costs of serialization. Is it much cheaper
to do it directly vs using `mccollect()`?


# Ideas

Write a function to check if code is IO bound.

Are there cheaper ways to share read only copies of objects between
processes in R? There's `bigmemory`, but what about something a little more
generalized like the plasma object store?


# Assumptions

I may want to make some of the following assumptions, depending on
convenience.

Input in a canonical form. Have to say precisely what this means. For
example:

- `<-` is used for assignment rather than `=` or `assign`
- All statements in the program are necessary, in the sense that they lead
  to something with a side effect.
- Existing `for` loops are unavoidable, ie. they do something like
  iterative updates. Otherwise they should be `lapply` type calls.

This can probably be done through preprocessing.
